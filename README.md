# Config files I use on Gnu + Linux

This repo will contain the config-files I would like to save for later reuse(when I jump over to another distro etc..)
Feel free to take them and do with them as you're want. 

# Why though?

It's the easiset way to do backups


# Requirements for to use:

If you want to use the .vimrc file you would need the following:
* Vundle

If you want to use i3status.conf or conf:
* i3 with all the packages needed for a basic install
